# snake_game
Version 0.0.1 - non working playground
TODO:
1. Turn snake's head
2. Add body textures
3. Collisions
4. Animate snake's head (static and moving)
5. Add .gitignore	


It would be fun to make head growing and splitting at some moment into chains. So, different fruits would generate different grow speed. Also, different fruits would generate different body chain colors, colorkeying 
and alpha-blending. And each snake would become different rainbow being. 

As long-term enhancement it would be interesting to generate splitted tail for some specific fruits.
