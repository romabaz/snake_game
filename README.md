# snake_game
Version 0.0.1 - non working playground
TODO:
1. Simplify body textures (no combinatorial approach)
2. Reduce clip size (50 pixels?)
3. Add food textures
4. Fix bug: when speed is 3 everything is broken
5. Fix bug: when randomly quickly changing directions everything is broken (try to do that with speed 1)
5. Collisions
6. Animate snake's head (static and moving)


It would be fun to make head growing and splitting at some moment into chains. So, different fruits would generate different grow speed. Also, different fruits would generate different body chain colors, colorkeying 
and alpha-blending. And each snake would become different rainbow being. 

As long-term enhancement it would be interesting to generate splitted tail for some specific fruits.
